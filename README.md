What Are Duas?

Duas are invocations or prayers made by Muslims to communicate with Allah (God). They are an essential part of Islamic worship and are deeply rooted in the Quran and the Sunnah (teachings and practices of Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him). Duas can be recited in times of joy, sorrow, need, or simply to express gratitude to the Almighty.
